piHeatingLCD

The LCD and buttons will work if:  
----------
* you have a schedule that always keep a low temperature  
* you have a single mode that pulls up the temperature  
* you have a single timer that pulls up the temperature

Log in with user 'admin' and the password you set up during the hub installation. 

Add sensor
----------
Add the sensor that will measure the temperature that will be regulated.   

Click  

	Input Sensors
	Scan for new sensors
	
When sensor is found, click  

	Done
	
Add devices
----------
Add the device that will control the heater.  

Click  

	Output Devices
	
Click  

	Add new
	
Click  

	Edit
	
on the newly added device.  
Set  
	Name: \<name\>
	GPIO Pin: 10
	Pin Active H/L: \<if you use the NO, then this should be 1\>

Click  

	Save
	Done
	Done	

Add mode
----------
This mode will pull up the temperature to the higher level indefinetely.  

Click  

	Modes
	Add new
	
Click  

	Edit
	
on the newly added mode, and set  

	Name: \<name\>
	
, for example 'Warm' to indicate it will be used to pull up the temperature.

Then click  

	Done
	
Add timer
----------
This timer will be used to pull up the temperature for a certain amount of time.  

Click  

	Timers
	Add new
	
Ã“n the newly created timer, click  

	Edit
	
Set  
	
	Name: \<name for the timer, perhaps 'Warm 6 hrs'\>
	Duration: \<the duration the timer will be active, in minutes, perhaps '360'\>
	
, then click  

	Save
	Done
	Done
	
Add schedules
----------
The first schedule will pull up the temperature once, or several times, a week.  

Click  

	Schedules
	Add new
	
Click  

	Edit
	
on the newly created schedule.  

This will be the schedule that pulls up the temperature once a week.  
Enter

	Name: \<name, for example 'Weekly meeting'\>
	Start time: \<some time before the temperature must be reached\>
	End time: \<the time when the temperature can start dropping\>
	Repeat schedule every: \<the day in question\>
	When sensors: \<sensor created earlier\> IS LESS THAN \<the high temperature you want to keep when it's high\>
	AND Timers: \<timer previously added\> STOPPED
	Activate Devices: \<mark the device you created before\>
	AND Modes: \<mode previously added\> OFF
	
Click  

	Save
	Done
	
The second schedule will use the mode created earlier to pull up the temperature indefinetely  

Add another timer as before and enter

	Name: \<name, for example 'Warm'\>
	Start time: 00:00:00
	End time: 23:59:59
	Repeat schedule every: \<mark all weekdays\>
	When sensors:  \<sensor created earlier\> IS LESS THAN \<the high temperature you want to keep\>
	AND Timers: \<timer previously added\> (IS IGNORED)
	Activate Devices: \<mark the device you created before\>
	AND Modes: \<mode previously added\> ON
	
Click  

	Save
	Done
	
The third schedule will use thetimer created earlier to pull up the temperature the time set  

Add another timer as before and enter

	Name: \<name, for example 'Warm, 6 hrs'\>
	Start time: 00:00:00
	End time: 23:59:59
	Repeat schedule every: \<mark all weekdays\>
	When sensors:  \<sensor created earlier\> IS LESS THAN \<the high temperature you want to keep\>
	AND Timers: \<timer previously added\> RUNNING
	Activate Devices: \<mark the device you created before\>
	AND Modes: \<mode previously added\> (IS IGNORED)
	
Click  

	Save
	Done
	
The fourth, and last, timer will keep the temperature low at all other times

Add another timer as before and enter

	Name: \<name, for example 'Cold'\>
	Start time: 00:00:00
	End time: 23:59:59
	Repeat schedule every:\<mark all weekdays\>
	When sensors: \<sensor created earlier\> IS LESS THAN \<the low temperature you want to keep\>
	AND Timers: \<timer previously added\> STOPPED
	Activate Devices: \<mark the device you created before\>
	AND Modes: \<mode previously added\> OFF
	
Click  

	Save
	Done
	Done

Note
==========
If you install on Raspberry Pi rev 1, you must edit  

	piHeatingLCD/config.ini
	
Change line from  

	lcd_d6        = 27
	
to  

	lcd_d6        = 21
