# pi-heating

Some scripts tweaked from https://github.com/JeffreyPowell, and many others created by me.  

Also there are CAD drawings and PCB layouts to build the electrical parts.  

Eventually you will have a Raspberry Pi that:

* controls (for example) a heater
* measures and logs your electric power consumption
* measures and logs numerous temperatures
* measures and logs wind direction and speed
* measures and logs rain
* presents it all via web GUI with some nice graphs
* also presents it on LCD displays
* can export logs to (spreadsheet or) csv

Let's start it all by

## Installing OS

Download 'Raspberry Pi OS Lite' from [https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/)  

Cd to where your download is and unpack it  
>$ unzip *-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip  

Insert SD-card and find out drive letter  
>$ dmesg  

For example /dev/mmcblk0 or /dev/sdb  

Unmount if mounted  
>$ umount /dev/mmcblk0p1  

Write image to SD-card  
>$ sudo dd bs=4M if=<version\>-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.img of=/dev/<device\> conv=fsync status=progress  

    1870659584 bytes (1,9 GB, 1,7 GiB) copied, 105 s, 17,8 MB/s  
    447+0 records in  
    447+0 records out  
    1874853888 bytes (1,9 GB, 1,7 GiB) copied, 139,716 s, 13,4 MB/s  

Remove SD-card and insert it again to make new partitions visible  

Mount the first partition  
>$ sudo mount /dev/<device\>1 /mnt/tmp  

Write empty file to boot partition to enable ssh at boot  
>$ sudo touch /mnt/tmp/ssh  

Remove SD-card and insert it in a RPi connected to your local network and boot it up  

## RPi configuration

### How to find RPi's IP

If you can't locate the IP, here's a little tutorial  

First find your subnet  
>$ ip -o -f inet addr show | awk '/scope global/ {print $4}'  

You will get something like  

    192.168.10.39/24  

where the first of is your ip, and the second is the netmask  

Now scan your local network for hosts  
>$ nmap -snP 192.168.10.0/24  

where the first is your subnet, and the last is the netmask  
Try to figure out which is your RPi from the output  

### How to connect without ssh password (optional)

If you haven't already, create a keypair  
>$ ssh-keygen ~/.ssh/id_rsa  

Copy the public key to RPi  
>$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@<IP\>  

### Connect and configure

>$ ssh <IP\> -l pi  

Login with user: pi and password:raspberry  

Update  
>$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt autoremove  

Configure  
>$ sudo raspi-config  

* 1    Change password  
* 2 N1 Change hostname  
* 4 T1 Set locales (I chose en_GB.UTF-8 and sv_SE.UTF-8, setting en_GB.UTF-8 as default)  
* 4 T2 Set time zone  
* 4 T3 Choose keyboard layout  
* 4 T4 Set wifi country  
* 5 P7 Enable 1-wire at boot  
* 7 A1 Expand file system to use whole SD-card  
* 7 A3 Set memory split to 16  

Reboot to set new options  

Now it's time to:

## Download sources

Install git, if you haven't already  
>$ sudo apt install git  

Download source files  
>$ git clone [https://github.com/jonsag/pi-heating.git](https://github.com/jonsag/pi-heating.git)  

## Installation

Go to the newly downloaded directory  

>$ cd pi-heating

and run the install script  

>$ sudo ./install.sh  

The script will ask you many questions, and you will have some options on each:  

* Click enter to accept the default 'yes'  
* Enter 'n' or 'N' to decline  
* Enter 'h' or 'H' to view the help explanation  

Also you will have to answer some questions during the installs themselves, especially when MariaDB is installed.

>$ curl localhost:8081/name.php?id=1 && echo  

change id=1 to id=2 etc  

See values  

>$ curl localhost:8081/value.php?id=1 && echo  

## piHeatingLCD

The LCD and buttons will work if:  

* you have a schedule that always keep a low temperature  
* you have a second schedule that pulls up the temperature at certain times  
* you have a single mode that pulls up the temperature  
* you have a single timer that pulls up the temperature

### Resources

Calculate burden resistor for your current clamp

>$ python resistor.py \<resistance\> \<tolerance\>  

### Usage

The LCD screen stays dark, unless pressing a button.  

* Button 1: Shows status  
* Button 2: Toggles mode, heats indefinitely  
* Button 3: Toggles timer, heats for set time  
* Button 4: Cancels both mode and timer  

### Note

If you install on Raspberry Pi rev 1, you must edit  

    piHeatingLCD/config.ini

Change line from  

    lcd_d6        = 27

to  

    lcd_d6        = 21

## piPowerTempLog

Build according to files in  

    Documents/ardPowerTempLog

This build requires an ethernet shield.  

## piWeatherLog

Build according to files in  

    Documents/ardWeatherLog

Connect the Arduino Weather Sensor to RPi  

Find out tty-device  

>$ dmesg | grep tty  

Probably named something like '/dev/ttyACM0'  
If not, edit  

    /var/www/piWeatherLog/weather.php  

Change line  

    $serial->deviceSet("/dev/ttyACM0");  

In file  

    /home/pi/bin/piWeatherLog/cron/bootWrapper.sh  

change lines  

    stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 cs8 9600 ign...  

and  

    screen -d -m -S init /dev/ttyACM0 9600

so it matches the output from dmesg command  

## The electrical builds

For all electrical builds there are CAD files for each project under 'Documentation'.  
Not all have finished PCB etch masks available as pdf.  
If you like to make some yourself, install KiCad ([https://www.kicad-pcb.org](https://www.kicad-pcb.org)) and just make them.  
I have made all as single layer PCBs myself, but just go ahead and route some double layered ones.  
If you don't want to make them them yourself, I can recommend JLCPCB ([https://jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com)), reasonably fast and very cheap.  

### piHeatingLCD

### ardPowerTempLog

![testing](Documents/images/ardWeatherLog-pcb_bottom.JPG  "ardPowerTempLog PCB bottom view")  

This build also require some current clamps.  

![ ](Documents/images/ardPowerTempLog-current_clamp.JPG  "ardPowerTempLog current clamp")  

I use three of these.  
If you go with other ones you will have to adapt your resistor values accordingly.  

Also, of course, you will need some DS18B20 1-wire temperature sensors.  

![ ](Documents/images/ardPowerTempLog-dallas.JPG  "ard>PowerTempLog temp sensor")  

Other ones will also do, but then check what library and settings you use in the Arduino sketch.  
I have soldered cables directly to the pins, and connected it to a phono plug.  

Then you will need some device to catch the blinks on your power meter.  

![ ](Documents/images/ardPowerTempLog-led_watch.JPG  "ardPowerLog LED watch")  

### ardWeatherLog

![ ](Documents/images/ardWeatherLog-full.JPG  "ardWeatherLog full")  

I use an ordinary ethernet cable to connect the Arduino to the weather sensors.  

The sensors are some devices I got from a cheap weather station.  
![ ](Documents/images/ardWeatherLog-sensors.JPG  "ardWeatherLog sensors")  
I just tossed the LCD that went with it.
